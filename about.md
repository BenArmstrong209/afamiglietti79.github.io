## Our Story

From the very beginning, we knew we wanted to have a farm some day. Over the course of the last five years, we worked to make that dream into a reality. We built up the soil from hard clay to rich, productive earth. We built raised beds to keep the roots of our plants safe as the water poured down the hillside. We built a sturdy fence to keep the deer and voles at bay. Now, at last, we have enough for our family, *and for yours.* 

## Why Radish Patch?

When we were first starting out, not much would grow! The hardy radish was always there for us though, so we named the place in it's honor. We still grow lots of beautiful french breakfast, easter egg, watermelon, and bier radishes!
